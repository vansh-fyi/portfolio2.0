# Case Study: DriQ Health – Scaling Product & Digital Presence

## 1. The "Before" State: A Broken Foundation (Freelance Phase)
Vansh Grover's engagement with DriQ Health began as a freelance web developer, inheriting a digital landscape in disarray.
* **The Problem:** The existing WordPress website was non-functional and actively detrimental to the brand. It was built by a "so-called developer" who had essentially scammed the company.
* **Key Flaws:**
    * **Visual Chaos:** Text overlapping images, broken layouts, no visual hierarchy.
    * **Lack of Purpose:** Failed to articulate the product's value proposition or features.
    * **Zero Conversion Focus:** No clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs), no lead generation pathways.
    * **SEO Neglect:** Completely unoptimized, making the product invisible to potential users.

## 2. The Digital Transformation: From Figma to Framer to Growth (Director Role)

### Phase A: Website Redesign & Branding Alignment
1.  **Initial Design & Conflict:** Vansh began by creating Figma mockups. Initial feedback involved a push for a "futuristic, neon-dark mode" (from the COO) versus an "Apple-inspired clean aesthetic" (from the CEO). Vansh designed both but quickly steered toward the clean, Apple-esque approach due to its broader appeal and alignment with the target audience (American healthcare facilities).
2.  **Color Palette Refinement:** Utilizing DriQ's existing blue and red logo, Vansh introduced a calming light blue hint, drawing inspiration from accessible UI palettes (like "Big Bang Theory" aesthetics) to create a friendly, trustworthy, and appealing feel for the American demographic.
3.  **Framer Implementation:** The website was built on Framer, incorporating interactive **Spline 3D models** for dynamic product showcases.
    * **Performance Iteration:** Initially, Spline models caused performance and SEO issues. Vansh proactively redesigned the site to optimize performance, demonstrating his ability to pivot based on technical constraints and business needs.
4.  **Photography Challenge:** Lacking professional product photography, Vansh ingeniously used **GPT-generated realistic images** and on-staff photos to populate the website, maintaining visual quality despite resource limitations.

### Phase B: SEO & Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)
Vansh spearheaded a cutting-edge **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** strategy to ensure DriQ Health appeared prominently not just in traditional search, but also in AI-driven search environments.
* **Comprehensive SEO:**
    * Implemented `LLMS TXT.txt` and optimized JavaScript metadata throughout the site for AI parsers.
    * Ensured `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` were correctly configured and integrated with Google Search Console.
    * Conducted extensive **trend analysis** using tools like **AnswerThePublic.com** and **Google Trends**. This included geo-targeting keywords around Philadelphia (DriQ's target market), then expanding to Pennsylvania and the entire US.
* **Content Strategy:** Advocated for and managed a **blog section** to enrich the website with valuable information, positioning DriQ as a reliable information source.

### Phase C: Digital Marketing & Lead Generation
Vansh expanded his role to encompass full-spectrum digital marketing.
* **Social Media Management:** Managed **LinkedIn (B2B)** and **Instagram (B2C)** strategies, creating engaging posts and polishing designs based on daily research.
* **Email Marketing:** Developed and executed email marketing campaigns to nurture leads.
* **B2B Conversion Focus:** The primary goal was converting website visitors into business leads for nursing homes and senior care facilities. Vansh's strategies successfully established the company's first B2B lead generation channel, acquiring **1+ new business leads per month**.

## 3. Physical Product Enhancement & AI Integration (Director Role)

### Physical Product UX & CAD Modeling
* **Vision:** The CEO wanted digital screens on the next phase of physical products. Vansh took the lead in designing both the embedded UI and the physical enclosures.
* **Tools & Process:**
    * Developed the **UI for the digital screens**.
    * Created **CAD models** for the physical enclosures using **OpenSCAD** (a code-based CAD software). He leveraged GPT for assistance with OpenSCAD coding.
    * Collaborated on the enclosure design, receiving specific chip dimensions from the embedded systems team to ensure perfect fit.
    * Created an interactive **Spline prototype** to visualize the physical product with the UI.
    * **3D Printing & Assembly:** The CAD models were 3D printed, and Vansh personally assembled them to validate the design.

### AI Integration
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Vansh worked closely with the Director of AI, staying informed about the ML implementation within the device. This ensured his design choices (UI, physical product) were technically informed and seamlessly integrated with the underlying AI capabilities.

## 4. Key Achievements & Impact
* **70x Traffic Growth:** From a mere **10 daily unique visitors to over 700**, a direct result of Vansh’s comprehensive digital strategy.
* **Strategic Design Leadership:** Transformed a broken website into a powerful, conversion-focused digital platform.
* **Holistic Product Development:** Contributed to both the digital (web, marketing) and physical (device UI/UX, CAD) aspects of the product ecosystem.
* **Established B2B Pipeline:** Created a consistent flow of business leads in a highly specialized market.
* **Problem-Solver:** Demonstrated an "all-round problem solver" mentality, as lauded by the CEO, by tackling challenges outside traditional design roles (SEO, marketing, CAD, photography).
