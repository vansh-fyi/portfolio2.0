# About Vansh Grover

Hi! I'm Vansh Grover, a **Product Designer** with a multidisciplinary skillset spanning **Frontend Development**, **AI-Powered Backend Development**, and **AI Engineering**. My journey blends design, technology, and innovation in unique ways.

## Professional Background

As a Product Designer, I specialize in creating intuitive, user-centered experiences across web and mobile applications. But I don't stop at design—I bring my visions to life through code. My frontend development skills allow me to implement responsive, performant interfaces using modern frameworks like React and TypeScript. On the backend, I build AI-powered systems that integrate machine learning models, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, and intelligent automation.

My AI Engineering expertise includes:
- Building conversational AI systems with LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Implementing semantic search and vector databases
- Designing and deploying AI-powered features in production applications
- Integrating AI tools like Mastra.AI, HuggingFace, and OpenAI APIs

## Background & Education

I started my academic journey in **Physics**, which gave me a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. However, I discovered my true passion lay at the intersection of design and technology. This realization led me to transition into **UX Design** and eventually expand into full-stack development and AI engineering.

Throughout my career, I've worked across diverse industries including:
- **Fintech**: Designing secure, user-friendly financial applications
- **Healthcare**: Creating accessible health monitoring solutions
- **SaaS**: Building scalable software-as-a-service products
- **E-commerce**: Developing intuitive shopping experiences

## Experience

I have over 4+ years of professional experience in Product Design and Development, with significant expertise in:
- Leading end-to-end design projects from research to implementation
- Building production-ready frontend applications
- Architecting AI-powered backend systems
- Mentoring teams and students in design thinking and technical skills

## Technical Skills

**Design**: Figma, Adobe XD, Prototyping, User Research, Design Systems, Accessibility  
**Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Responsive Design  
**Backend**: Node.js, tRPC, REST APIs, Serverless (Vercel)  
**AI/ML**: RAG Systems, Vector Databases (Supabase pgvector), LLM Integration, Embeddings  
**Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Supabase, Vercel

## The Turning Point

In November 2022, a gas leak accident resulted in 70% burns, forcing me to take a nine-month break from my career. This challenging period became a catalyst for personal growth and reflection. During my recovery, I worked as an **Assistant Professor at DIT University** in Dehradun, where I discovered a passion for teaching and mentoring students in design and technology.

This experience profoundly shaped my perspective on resilience, adaptability, and the importance of sharing knowledge with the next generation.

## Inspirations & Influences

I draw inspiration from cutting-edge research in AI and robotics. Organizations pushing the boundaries of technology include:
- **Google DeepMind** & **Google Research** for their pioneering work in AI
- **Toyota Research Institute (TRI)** for innovations in robotics and autonomous systems
- **NVIDIA Research** for advancements in AI hardware and software
- **Meta Reality Labs/FAIR** for VR/AR and AI research
- **Disney Research** for creative applications of technology

## Beyond Work

When I'm not designing or coding, I'm an avid **traveler** and **trekker**. Exploring different cultures and landscapes enriches my design perspective—I believe the best ideas come from diverse experiences and interactions with people from all walks of life.

There's a duality in my personality: while I thrive in collaborative design sessions and team environments, I also value deep, focused work on complex technical challenges. This balance between extroversion and introspection allows me to excel both as a creative designer and a technical implementer.

## Vision & Goals

I'm driven by a moonshot goal that ties back to my physics roots: **bridging the physical and digital worlds through AI and spatial computing**. I envision a future where intelligent systems seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, enhancing human capabilities while remaining intuitive and accessible.

My current focus areas include:
- Building AI-powered design tools that democratize creativity
- Creating intelligent portfolio experiences that adapt to user needs
- Exploring the intersection of generative AI and user experience design
- Developing AI agents that can assist in complex design and development workflows

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of design, technology, and AI. Whether you're looking for a Product Designer who can code, an AI Engineer who understands UX, or simply want to chat about the future of technology—I'd love to hear from you!
