# Story 1.2: Component Migration

Status: drafted

## Story

As a developer,
I want to break down the existing `index.html` into reusable React components (e.g., Header, Hero, Skills, Projects, About, Testimonials, Contact, Footer),
so that the application is modular and maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Given** the `index.html` file
2.  **When** I view the component structure in the React project
3.  **Then** I see a logical breakdown of the page into smaller components.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create a `components` directory in `portfolio-react/src` (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Header` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Hero` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Skills` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Projects` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create an `About` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Testimonials` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Contact` component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create a `Footer` component (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

This story is derived from Epic 1: Core Application & React Migration. The goal is to modularize the frontend by breaking down the static `index.html` into reusable React components, as specified in the PRD and `epics.md`.

### Project Structure Notes

- Components should be placed in the `portfolio-react/src/components/` directory as per the architecture.
- The previous story (1.1) has a status of "drafted" and has not been implemented yet, so there are no learnings to apply.
