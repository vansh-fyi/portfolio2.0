# Case Study: Ovik Finance

## 1. Context: The Intern in the Lead
Just one month into his design career at **Synoriq**, Vansh Grover was selected for a high-stakes opportunity: to act as the **sole, on-site designer** for Ovik Finance.
* **The Vote of Confidence:** Despite being a trainee, Vansh was chosen over senior designers because the VP and Design Head trusted his **communication skills** to handle a direct, fluctuating client relationship.
* **The Schedule:** A grueling 2-week sprint requiring daily travel to the client’s office to design "live" and hash out ideas in real-time.

## 2. The Problem: Ambiguity & Complexity
The project faced two distinct hurdles:
1.  **The "Vague Vision" Syndrome:** The client struggled to articulate requirements, often not knowing what they wanted until they saw a high-fidelity design. Requirements shifted mid-conversation, demanding immense patience and adaptability.
2.  **Domain Complexity:** Supply Chain Finance is dense. Coming from a non-finance background, Vansh had to rapidly upskill to understand the workflow without letting the complexity overwhelm the user interface.
3.  **The Competitive Landscape:** Ovik’s local competitors were managing operations manually. Ovik wanted a sophisticated app to position themselves as a modern, tech-forward leader.

## 3. The Process: On-Site & User-Centric

### A. "Live" Design Sessions
Instead of the traditional "Design -> Feedback -> Iteration" loop, Vansh operated in a **Real-Time Design** environment.
* He sat with the client all day, translating their fluctuating verbal ideas into concrete UI screens immediately.
* This approach bridged the visualization gap, allowing the client to make decisions faster.

### B. Guerilla User Research
While the client provided direction, Vansh insisted on validating with actual users.
* **The Opportunity:** He seized the chance to interview **three of Ovik's clients** who happened to be visiting the office.
* **The Insight:** These interviews revealed the communication gaps and pain points in the current manual process, ensuring the app solved real problems rather than just perceived ones.

## 4. Design Solutions: Humanizing FinTech

### A. Financial Literacy UX
Vansh realized that the end-users (Ovik's customers) might not be finance experts.
* **The Jargon Fix:** He prioritized simplifying the app's language. Instead of raw financial data, the copy was crafted to be helpful and non-intimidating.
* **Tooltips:** Designed a system of interactive **Tooltips** to explain specific financial terms and section functions, educating the user as they navigated the app.

### B. Onboarding & Walkthroughs
When the client expressed worry about onboarding new users to a digital platform:
* **The Solution:** Vansh proposed and designed a comprehensive **Walkthrough Sequence**. This guided first-time users through the app’s core value propositions, reducing the learning curve.

### C. High-Fidelity UI
Starting from basic wireframes provided by a senior, Vansh built the entire visual layer.
* **Visual Identity:** Established a new color palette and a library of custom components and illustrations.
* **Interactive Prototype:** Created a fully clickable prototype that detailed the user journey from onboarding to finance management.

## 5. Outcome & Growth
* **Deliverables:** A comprehensive **Design System** and a **High-Fidelity Interactive Prototype**.
* **Business Impact:** The app successfully positioned Ovik Finance as a technological pioneer in a market dominated by manual workflows.
* **Personal Growth:** This project was a crash course in corporate survival. Vansh learned to manage **Timesheets and Design Costing**, understood the importance of **MoM (Minutes of Meeting)**, and sharpened his ability to thrive in a high-pressure, client-facing environment.
