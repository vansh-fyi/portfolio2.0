## Process
*Can not disclose due to NDA*

## Project Overview

DriQ Health is a digital health solution designed to improve the quality of life for seniors experiencing incontinence. The system combines IoT sensors, mobile applications, and caregiver dashboards to provide discreet, real-time monitoring and alerts, enabling proactive care and dignity for patients.

## The Challenge

Incontinence affects millions of seniors worldwide and can lead to:
- **Health complications**: Skin issues, infections, and discomfort
- **Loss of dignity**: Embarrassment and social isolation
- **Caregiver burden**: Constant checking and reactive care
- **Healthcare costs**: Increased need for medical interventions

Traditional monitoring methods rely on manual checks, which are:
- Intrusive and privacy-invasive
- Time-consuming for caregivers
- Reactive rather than proactive
- Inconsistent in quality

## The Solution

DriQ Health provides a comprehensive monitoring system that:
1. **Detects incidents** using non-invasive IoT sensors
2. **Alerts caregivers** in real-time via mobile app
3. **Tracks patterns** to predict and prevent incidents
4. **Maintains dignity** through discreet, automated monitoring
5. **Provides insights** for healthcare providers to improve care plans

## Key Features

### For Seniors (Patients)
- **Discreet Monitoring**: Non-intrusive wearable sensors
- **Comfort First**: Medical-grade, skin-safe materials
- **Privacy Protection**: Data encrypted and HIPAA-compliant
- **Emergency Alerts**: Fall detection and health anomaly detection

### For Caregivers
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Instant notifications when assistance is needed
- **Historical Data**: Track patterns and improve care routines
- **Multi-Patient Management**: Dashboard for managing multiple residents (nursing homes)
- **Caregiver Notes**: Document care activities and observations

### For Healthcare Providers
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Population health insights and trends
- **Care Plan Integration**: Sync with existing EHR systems
- **Predictive Alerts**: AI-powered predictions for proactive interventions
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated reporting for healthcare regulations



## Design Considerations

### Privacy & Dignity
- Minimal data collection (only what's medically necessary)
- Anonymous data in aggregated reports
- Patient consent and control over data sharing

### Accessibility
- Large text and high-contrast UI for aging eyes
- Voice commands for hands-free operation
- Multi-language support for diverse populations
- Proper alt texts for visually handicapped users

### Usability
- Simple, intuitive interface for non-tech-savvy users
- Clear visual indicators (color-coded alerts)
- One-tap actions for common tasks

## Impact

- **Reduced response time**: From 30+ minutes to under 2 minutes
- **B2B Leads**: Generated 12+ B2B leads during his contract
- **Engagement**: Increased average session time by 1400% to achieve company's goal of better brand outreach.
- **70x Growth**: Increased daily unique visitors from ~10 to 700+.
- **Brand Awareness**: Increased brand awareness to achieve company's goal of better brand outreach.

## Technologies Used

- Can not disclose due to NDA

## Lessons Learned

1. **Empathy is Critical**: Spent significant time with end-users (seniors and caregivers) to understand their needs
2. **Regulatory Complexity**: Healthcare compliance (HIPAA, GDPR) adds significant development overhead
3. **Battery Life**: IoT devices must last weeks without charging in real-world settings
4. **Caregiver Burnout**: Technology must reduce, not add to, caregiver workload
5. **Trust**: In healthcare, trust is earned through reliability and transparency
6. **Business Model**: B2B business models perform better than B2C models in healthcare.

DriQ Health demonstrates how thoughtful design and technology can address sensitive healthcare challenges while preserving dignity and improving outcomes.
