# Case Study: Synovein – The Loan Authentication Engine

## 1. Context: The On-Site Pressure Cooker
Vansh Grover was deployed as the **sole designer** on-site at the client’s office (**CSL Finance** in Noida).
* **The Situation:** Far from his design mentors in Jaipur, Vansh had to make autonomous design decisions in a high-pressure environment.
* **The Constraints:**
    * **Time:** A strict 9-to-5 client office schedule meant no "working late" to catch up. Efficiency was paramount.
    * **Split Focus:** Vansh juggled the entire end-to-end design of Synovein while simultaneously contributing to **Synofin LMS**.
    * **Daily Pitches:** The Product Manager pitched new features to the client *every day*, requiring Vansh to deliver polished prototypes on a 24-hour cycle.

## 2. The Domain Hurdle: Learning "Loan Sanctioning" Overnight
The terminology of B2B FinTech (RCU, Sanctioning, Disbursement) was initially alien to Vansh.
* **The Breakthrough:** Sensing the struggle, the Product Manager conducted a late-night whiteboard session, mapping out the entire financial process.
* **The Result:** This crash course gave Vansh the domain confidence to move forward independently, proving his ability to absorb complex logic rapidly.

## 3. Strategic Design: The "Suite" Approach
Vansh and his PM evaluated the existing legacy screens and made the strategic call to **start from scratch**.
* **The "Microsoft Office" Logic:** To create a unified brand experience, Vansh aligned Synovein’s UX with the company’s flagship product, **Synofin LMS**.
* **Navigation Shift:** He scrapped the initial Side-Navigation concept in favor of a **Top-Navigation Bar**. This mirrored the flagship product, reducing the learning curve for users already familiar with the Synoriq ecosystem.

## 4. The Usability Pivot: From "Chat" to "Decision"
Vansh conducted his first-ever professional usability test with high-level stakeholders (The Heads of **RCU** and **Legal**). This session fundamentally changed the product.

### The "Before" State
Vansh initially designed the Document Review section as a **Chat-Style Thread**, assuming a conversational flow would be modern and easy.

### The Feedback
The stakeholders rejected the conversational model. They didn't want to "chat"; they needed to make **formal, binding decisions**.

### The "After" State (The Redesign)
Vansh completely overhauled the flow to create a **Structured Decision Hub**:
* **Clear Actions:** Replaced chat bubbles with distinct **'Approve'**, **'Reject'**, and **'Send Back'** buttons.
* **Formal Remarks:** Created structured fields for report details and official remarks, transforming the tool from a conversation app into a powerful **Audit & Decision Platform**.

## 5. Key Feature: Role-Based Navigation
Designing for niche B2B experts meant handling massive data density without cognitive overload.
* **The Solution:** Vansh implemented **Dynamic Tabbed Views**.
* **How it Works:**
    * An **Admin** sees all tabs (Technical, Legal, RCU, Credit).
    * A **Legal Officer** sees *only* the Legal tab.
* **Impact:** The interface intelligently adapts to the user's role, streamlining their workflow by hiding irrelevant data.

## 6. Outcome & Deliverables
Despite the split workload and remote isolation, Vansh delivered:
1.  A comprehensive **Design System** (built from scratch).
2.  A **High-Fidelity Prototype** validated by senior stakeholders.
3.  A final **Web App Design** ready for client pitching.

This project was a period of massive professional growth, teaching Vansh that **"The best way to understand a complex problem is to talk to the experts."**
