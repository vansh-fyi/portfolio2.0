# Case Study: DIT University School of Design – The Stakeholder Balancing Act

## 1. Context: The Professor as Practitioner
While serving as an Assistant Professor at DIT University, Vansh Grover identified a critical gap in the department's digital presence. He presided over a team of students tasked with redesigning the website.
* **The Intervention:** After reviewing initial student concepts, Vansh stepped in to lead the redesign of the "Hero Section" and core architecture himself, using the project as a live teaching moment for his students on how to handle complex, real-world design constraints.

## 2. The Challenge: The "Three-Body" Problem
The project was defined by conflicting expectations from three distinct user groups, creating a fascinating UX puzzle:
1.  **The Dean (The Boss):** Demanded a "Minimal and Sophisticated" aesthetic to rival top global design schools.
2.  **The Parents (The Payers):** Research with the Admissions Department revealed that parents—the primary decision-makers—found "minimalism" confusing. They wanted clarity, trust, and immediate information.
3.  **The Students (The Users):** The site needed to appeal to Gen Z, feeling modern and exciting enough to encourage enrollment.

## 3. Technical Constraints: The "Black Box"
Vansh faced a significant technical hurdle typical of institutional legacy systems.
* **The Template Trap:** The university had hired a freelance development firm that was working off a rigid template.
* **The Blockade:** The firm refused to share source files, Figma assets, or documentation.
* **The Solution:** Vansh had to "Reverse Engineer" the existing constraints to build a Design System that *looked* new but could technically function within the unchangeable architecture of the vendor's template.

## 4. The Design Process: Math, Metaphor, & Photography

### A. Research & Inspiration
* **Benchmarking:** Studied global leaders like **Parsons** and the **Royal College of Art**. Vansh noted their heavy use of whitespace but consciously rejected their "overuse of red," aiming for a palette that felt more unique to DIT.
* **Content Creation:** Instead of using stock images, Vansh utilized an ongoing student exhibition. He personally photographed standout student projects to ensure the website showcased authentic talent.

### B. The "Golden Ratio" Concept (Iteration 1)
True to his Physics background, Vansh built the initial concept entirely around mathematical harmony.
* **The Grid:** He created a composition using the **Golden Ratio** to place elements.
* **The Visuals:** Featured students "popping out" of Golden Ratio enclosures, surrounded by their work.
* **Symbolism:** The background icons followed a Golden Spiral. The word "DESIGN" was typographically illustrated using signifiers of the trade:
    * *Prototype wires* connecting letters.
    * *Pencil sketches* blending into *WiFi signals* (symbolizing the bridge between traditional sketching and futuristic tech).

### C. The Pivot (Iteration 2)
* **The Critique:** The Dean felt the illustrative "DESIGN" typography was "too comical" and lacked the required sophistication.
* **The Refinement:** Vansh stripped back the illustrative elements. He retained the **Golden Ratio Image Grids** (for mathematical balance) but pivoted to a cleaner, **Typography-Driven Layout**. This satisfied the Dean’s need for "Sophistication" while maintaining the layout clarity parents needed.

## 5. Information Architecture: The "Laws of UX" Influence
Vansh attempted to streamline the navigation to save clicks.
* **The Proposal:** Direct Course Exploration CTAs (Calls to Action) right on the homepage.
* **The Compromise:** University officials mandated a split between "Undergraduate" and "Post-Graduate" landing pages to match their internal sitemap.
* **The Solution:** Inspired by the layout of the **"Laws of UX" website**, Vansh designed the course list pages to be visually distinct and easy to scan, ensuring that the **UX Design Course** (the department's highest revenue generator) was prominent and accessible.

## 6. Outcome & Learnings
The project concluded with the delivery of a **High-Fidelity Responsive Design**, an **Interactive Prototype**, and an **Initial Design System**.
* **The Reality:** Due to university budget scope limitations regarding the external vendor, the design was not fully developed.
* **The Lesson:** This project remains one of Vansh’s most valuable experiences in **Design Management**. It taught him (and his students) that:
    1.  **Design is Politics:** Managing the Dean vs. Admissions conflict is as important as the UI itself.
    2.  **Constraints Breed Creativity:** Building a design system without access to the codebase requires rigorous reverse-engineering.
    3.  **Inclusivity:** Designing for the "Parent" (User A) without alienating the "Student" (User B) is the ultimate test of empathy.
