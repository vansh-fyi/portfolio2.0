## Process
*See Section 2: Phase 1 & Section 3: The Vibio Solution*

## 1. Context: The 7-Day Sprint
[cite_start]Vibio was conceptualized and designed during the **Vibe-X Designathon** organized by **Sandcup Design Studio**, where Vansh Grover’s team secured the **Runner-Up** position[cite: 66].
* **The Challenge:** Design a platform specifically for "Creatives."
* **The Constraint:** A high-pressure 7-day timeline to go from abstract problem statement to a holistic, viable product.
* **The Team Dynamic:** While there was no assigned leader, Vansh naturally stepped into the role of the "glue"—aligning Business (Surabhi), UI (Anup/Udit), and Strategy to ensure a cohesive product launch.

## 2. Phase 1: Research & Definition
### Defining "Creative"
The first hurdle was the ambiguity of the prompt.
* **The Debate:** Is a cook a creative? Is a developer?
* **The Decision:** To avoid diluting the product's focus, the team narrowed the scope to **Visual & Digital Arts**: UI/UX Designers, Animators, Filmmakers, and 3D Artists.

### Research Methodology
* **Primary Research:** Vansh conducted telephonic interviews with creative professionals to identify specific pain points (isolation, lack of constructive feedback).
* **Secondary Research:** Anup analyzed Reddit threads for community frustrations.
* **Strategic Analysis:** Vansh studied the growth documentaries of Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram to understand the mechanics of **community building** and **engagement loops**.

## 3. The "Vibio" Solution: Features & Innovation

### A. The Lounge (Immersive Event Experience)
Vansh pitched a feature called **"The Lounge"** to solve the sterility of online events. which was designed by his team mate Udit.
* **Concept:** Replicating "Offline Energy" in an online space.
* **Nomenclature:** Instead of "Channels" or "Tabs," the app uses terms like **"Auditorium," "Conference Hall," and "Room 1."**
* **Networking Hub:** A LinkedIn-style sub-feature within the Lounge allowing real-time connection during events.

### B. The Design Spirit (AI & Gamification)
To drive retention, Vansh introduced a metaphorical concept given form.
* **The Logic:** Users take an initial quiz which generates a **"Design Spirit"**—an AI-powered avatar/personality.
* **Evolution:** As the user participates in Daily Challenges (Quick UI tasks) or Weekly Challenges (Deep work like 3D Rendering), their Spirit evolves.
* **Spirit Chat:** Users can chat with their AI Spirit for guidance or reflection.

### C. The Vent Wall
Recognizing that creative work can be frustrating, the team added a **"Vent Wall"**—a safe, communal space for creatives to express frustrations, fostering emotional bonding among users.

## 4. Business Strategy & Go-To-Market
Unlike many designathon entries that focus only on UI, Vansh and Surabhi built a robust business case.

### Revenue Model
* **Generous Free Tier:** Solo hosts can hold workshops for up to 10 attendees for free.
* **Per-Capita Pricing:** For events >10 users, the host pays a fee per attendee.
* **Ticket Commissions:** Vibio takes a percentage cut of paid event tickets.

### Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy
* **Ambassador Program:** Leveraging Campus Ambassadors to capture the student market.
* **Initial Rollout:** Targeting 100 "Small-Time Creators" to host micro-events, seeding the content ecosystem.
* **KPIs:** Established metrics for the first 4 Quarters, leveraging the **$10 Million creative economy** potential in India to justify the valuation.

## 5. Design & Branding
Vansh personally led the Visual Identity.
* **Naming:** "Vibio" was chosen for being phonetic, easy to speak, and soft-sounding (avoiding harsh syllables).
* **The Logo:** Constructed using the **Golden Ratio** to ensure geometric perfection.
* **Design System:** Created a unified system of typography and color variables that allowed Anoop and Udit to build the UI screens rapidly without inconsistency.

## 6. The Outcome
* [cite_start]**Award:** The holistic approach—combining a stunning UI with a calculated business model and psychological hooks (Vent Wall/Spirit)—earned the team the **Runner-Up** title[cite: 66].
* **Leadership:** This project solidified Vansh’s ability to manage cross-functional concerns (Business + Design + Tech) under extreme deadlines.
