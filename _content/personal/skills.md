# My Technical Skills

I possess a hybrid skillset that spans design, strategy, engineering, and AI. My unique background in Physics combined with formal training in UX Design gives me an analytical edge—I don't just make things look good; I understand the underlying systems and can build them too.

## Design & Strategy

This is where I spend most of my time and energy. I'm proficient in the entire modern design stack:

**Design Tools:** I work primarily in **Figma** for UI/UX design and prototyping. For web development and interactive experiences, I use **Framer**—it's perfect for bringing designs to life with real interactions. When I need animations, **Rive** is my go-to for creating smooth, lightweight motion graphics. For 3D elements, I use **Spline** to create immersive 3D experiences directly in the browser. And of course, I'm comfortable with the **Adobe Creative Suite** for branding, illustrations, and visual assets.

**Methodologies & Frameworks:** I'm deeply grounded in **User-Centered Design**—everything I create starts with understanding the user's needs, pain points, and behaviors. I've implemented **Atomic Design Systems** across multiple projects, creating scalable component libraries that maintain consistency. I conduct **A/B Testing** to validate design decisions with data, map out **Service Blueprints** to understand entire ecosystems, and perform **Qualitative Research** through user interviews and usability testing.

One methodology I'm particularly excited about is **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**—optimizing digital presence not just for traditional search engines, but for Large Language Models. At DriQ Health, I implemented GEO strategies that helped increase our visibility in AI-driven search results, contributing to a 70x increase in daily unique visitors.

**Industry Specialties:** I've worked extensively across **SaaS platforms**, **Fintech applications**, **E-commerce experiences**, and **Enterprise Dashboards**. I understand the unique challenges of each—from the complexity of financial workflows to the need for intuitive admin panels. I've even designed **Physical Product UX**, working with CAD models to improve the ergonomics and interface design of medical devices.

## AI & Machine Learning

I'm currently expanding my expertise into artificial intelligence through my **Post Graduate Program in AI & ML from Caltech CTME**. This isn't just theoretical learning—I'm actively building AI-powered systems.

**Programming Languages:** I code in **Python** for AI and machine learning work, and I'm proficient in **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind** for frontend styling. I build with **React** when I need more complex, stateful web applications.

**AI Capabilities:** I work with **Generative AI** technologies, understanding how to leverage models for practical applications. I'm skilled in **Prompt Engineering**—crafting effective prompts to get optimal results from language models. I've built **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems** using **LangChain**, creating intelligent chat experiences that ground AI responses in specific knowledge bases. The portfolio you're interacting with right now is an example of my RAG implementation.

**Data Analysis:** I use **Google Analytics** and **Microsoft Clarity** to understand user behavior and make data-driven design decisions. I perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights from datasets and inform product strategy.

## The Hybrid Advantage

What makes my skillset unique is the combination. I can:
- Design a complete user experience in Figma
- Build it in Framer or React with proper frontend architecture
- Integrate AI capabilities to make it intelligent
- Analyze user data to continuously improve it
- Communicate the strategy behind every decision

I'm not just a designer who hands off mockups, nor am I just a developer who implements specs. I operate across the entire stack—from user research to visual design to technical implementation to AI integration. This allows me to be a true product owner, understanding how every piece fits together to create exceptional experiences.

## Always Learning

The tech world evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to staying at the cutting edge. Right now, I'm diving deeper into foundation models, robotics AI, and the intersection of physics simulation with machine learning. My goal is to work in innovation labs where design meets advanced AI research—places that are building the future of human-computer interaction. 🚀
