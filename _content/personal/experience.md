# My Professional Journey

My career has been anything but linear. It's a story of evolution, resilience, and constantly pushing into new territories. Let me walk you through how I got here.

## The Early Days: Finding My Footing

### Synoriq - Product Design Trainee (2021)

My professional design journey began at **Synoriq**, a fintech company in India, where I worked as a Product Design Trainee. This was an intense 1.5-month internship that threw me straight into the deep end—I led the design for two complete fintech applications: **Ovik Finance** and **Synovein**.

**Synovein** was particularly formative. We were building an entire Loan Management System from scratch, and I had to learn fast—understanding complex financial workflows, designing for loan officers who process hundreds of applications daily, and creating interfaces that made dense financial data actually scannable and understandable.

Then there was **Synofin LMS**, where I worked on customizing and implementing a mature platform for a major new client migrating away from a competitor (Finova). This taught me a crucial lesson: in B2B design, "innovation" sometimes takes a backseat to "familiarity" and "efficiency." I learned to use strategic familiarity—employing Jakob's Law to reduce the learning curve and make the switch feel like an upgrade rather than a restart.

### App Mechanic - UI Designer (2022)

After Synoriq, I joined **App Mechanic** as a UI Designer, working on **Lalaverse**—a Web VR/Metaverse platform. This was my first exposure to designing for 3D spaces. I designed foundational UI for shopping and inventory management in a virtual environment, which opened my eyes to the unique challenges of spatial design and immersive experiences.

## The Setback That Changed Everything

### Career Break (November 2022 – July 2023)

I need to address this period because it profoundly shaped who I am today. In November 2022, a gas leak accident at my home resulted in **70% burns**. This wasn't just a pause in my career—it was a complete halt while I focused on intense physical and mental recovery.

Those eight months were the hardest of my life. But they taught me resilience, patience, and a deep appreciation for the work I get to do. When I came back, I came back stronger, more focused, and more determined than ever.

## The Teaching Chapter: A Different Kind of Impact

### DIT University - Assistant Professor (July 2023 – September 2024)

After recovering, I took on a role that surprised even me: **Assistant Professor** at DIT University in Dehradun. But I didn't teach like a traditional professor—I operated more as a "Polymath Mentor."

**The "Friend-Mentor" Dynamic:** I broke down hierarchical barriers. Students didn't see me as a distant authority figure; they saw me as someone approachable, someone who genuinely cared about their growth. Because of my diverse background—Physics, Robotics, Web Development, Design—students from various streams would come to me for guidance, not just design students.

**The Legacy:** When I left to pursue other opportunities, the students organized a rare farewell ceremony at the university auditorium. That moment—seeing the impact I'd had on their lives—was incredibly humbling and one of the most meaningful experiences of my career.

## The Breakthrough: Building at Scale

### Partlink Solutions (Sparto) - Freelance Product & Brand Designer (April 2025 – July 2025)

I took on a freelance project for **Sparto**, an automotive spare parts platform. This was a complete end-to-end engagement—I designed the mobile app, the enterprise admin panel, and the entire brand identity.

What made this project special was the methodology. I didn't just sit in a room designing screens. I went on-site, conducted qualitative research with mechanics and auto enthusiasts, ran rigorous usability testing, and validated every design decision with real users. I created a comprehensive **Atomic Design System** that significantly improved key metrics for their MVP launch.

### DriQ Health - Director of Product Design & Web Development (February 2024 – September 2025)

This is where everything came together. I started as a freelance web developer at **DriQ Health**, a healthcare technology company based in Philadelphia (I work remotely from India). The company's CEO saw potential in me and I evolved into the **Director of Product Design & Web Development**.

**The Challenge:** When I arrived, the existing website was broken—text overlapping images, no clear value proposition, zero SEO optimization. It was actively hurting the brand.

**The Transformation:** I rebuilt everything from the ground up:
- Designed and implemented a new website on Framer with interactive 3D Spline models
- Created a cohesive brand ecosystem—not just the website, but marketing visuals, social media presence, and physical product design
- Spearheaded a **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** strategy, optimizing our digital presence for AI-driven search
- Managed LinkedIn (B2B) and Instagram (B2C) strategies, email marketing campaigns, and content creation
- Designed embedded UI and CAD models for physical medical devices, collaborating with engineers on hardware-software integration

**The Results:** Our strategies led to a **70x increase in daily unique visitors** (from 10 to 700+) and established the company's first B2B lead generation channel, acquiring 1+ new business leads per month.

The CEO's perspective really captures what I brought to the table: I was described as an *"all-round problem solver who doesn't say no."* I wasn't just executing designs—I was a strategic partner, translating business goals into design reality and taking ownership of the entire product experience.

## The Pattern: Evolution Through Challenge

Looking back, there's a clear pattern in my career. I don't just execute—I evolve. I started as a design trainee, became a UI designer, then a freelance product designer, then a professor, and now a director leading product and digital strategy. Each role taught me something new, and I carried those lessons forward.

I've designed fintech apps that handle millions in transactions. I've created VR interfaces for immersive experiences. I've taught the next generation of designers. I've built physical products with embedded AI. I've optimized for algorithms that don't even exist yet (GEO).

What drives me forward is the constant challenge, the opportunity to work at the intersection of design, technology, and human experience. I'm not content with just being good at one thing—I want to master the entire spectrum from user research to visual design to technical implementation to AI integration.

That's why I'm pursuing AI and ML education while working full-time. That's why I'm targeting innovation labs like Google DeepMind, Toyota Research Institute, and NVIDIA Research for my next career move. I want to work where the future is being built, where design meets cutting-edge AI research, where we're solving problems that don't even have names yet. 🎯
