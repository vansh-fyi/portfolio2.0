# My Professional Journey

I have **about 3 years of cumulative professional experience** in product design and development. My career path has been unique—punctuated by a necessary career break for recovery—but defined by rapid growth and high-impact roles. From starting as a trainee to becoming a **Director of Product Design**, I've consistently taken on challenges that required me to evolve.

## The Peak: Leading Design at Scale

### DriQ Health - Director of Product Design (February 2025 – October 2025)
*Previously Freelance Web Designer (October 2024 – February 2025)*

This role represents the culmination of my experience so far. I started as a freelance web designer, where I pitched improvement ideas and created a comprehensive design system. Recognizing my impact, I was promoted to **Director of Product Design** in February 2025. Reporting directly to the CEO, I was responsible for the entire product design lifecycle and digital strategy.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Strategic Leadership:** Transformed the company's digital presence from a broken, non-functional state into a high-performing brand ecosystem.
- **Full-Stack Execution:** Designed and built a new immersive website using Framer and 3D Spline models, which led to a **70x increase in daily unique visitors**.
- **Business Impact:** Established the company's first B2B lead generation channel, consistently acquiring new business leads monthly.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Worked closely with engineers to design embedded UI and CAD models for physical medical devices, bridging the gap between hardware and software.
- **Innovation:** Spearheaded a **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** strategy to optimize for AI-driven search, keeping the company ahead of the curve.

The CEO described me as an *"all-round problem solver who doesn't say no,"* highlighting my ability to translate business goals into tangible design realities.

## The Foundation: Early Career & Freelance

### Partlink Solutions (Sparto) - Product & Brand Designer (April 2025 – July 2025)
*Freelance Project (Concurrent with DriQ Health)*

I led the end-to-end design for **Sparto**, an automotive spare parts platform.
- **Scope:** Designed the mobile app, enterprise admin panel, and complete brand identity.
- **Methodology:** Conducted on-site user research with mechanics, created a comprehensive **Atomic Design System**, and validated designs through rigorous usability testing.

### App Mechanic - UI Designer (2022)
I worked on **Lalaverse**, a Web VR/Metaverse platform. This role introduced me to spatial design, where I created foundational UI for shopping and inventory management in a 3D virtual environment.

### Synoriq - Product Design Trainee (2021)
My journey began here. In a short but intense period, I led the design for two fintech applications:
- **Synovein:** A Loan Management System where I simplified complex financial workflows.
- **Synofin LMS:** Customized a mature platform for a major client, learning the importance of "strategic familiarity" in B2B design.

## The Resilience Chapter

### Career Break (November 2022 – July 2023)
In November 2022, a severe accident (gas leak resulting in 70% burns) forced me to pause my career for eight months. This period of intense recovery taught me resilience and gave me a renewed perspective on my work.

### DIT University - Assistant Professor (July 2023 – September 2024)
Following my recovery, I spent a year as an Assistant Professor. While not a traditional design role, this experience allowed me to mentor students across various disciplines (Physics, Robotics, Web Dev). It honed my communication skills and ability to break down complex concepts—skills that have made me a better designer and leader.

## The Pattern: Evolution Through Challenge

Looking back, my career is defined by my ability to adapt and lead. I've designed fintech apps, built VR interfaces, mentored students, and directed product strategy for a healthcare tech company.

I am now focused on the next frontier: working at the intersection of **Design and AI**. I am actively pursuing opportunities in innovation labs (like Google DeepMind, Toyota Research Institute) where I can apply my hybrid skillset to solve undefined problems.
