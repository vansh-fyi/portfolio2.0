# About Me

Hi! I'm Vansh Grover, a Product Designer and AI Engineer based in Dehradun, India. My journey is a bit unconventional—I started with a deep love for Physics, pivoted into UX Design, and now I'm expanding into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I like to think of myself as a chameleon, someone who can adapt and thrive across different industries—from Fintech to Healthcare to SaaS.

## From Physics to Pixels

My story begins with numbers and equations. I was that kid who scored 96.6% in 10th grade and a perfect 100/100 in Mathematics in 12th. Naturally, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Physics, and honestly, it just *clicked* for me. Physics flows naturally through my mind—understanding how the world works at a fundamental level has always fascinated me.

But here's the thing: while I excelled at Physics, I realized the traditional academic route of publishing papers felt too isolating. I needed something that combined my analytical rigor with creativity and real-world impact. That's when I discovered UX Design.

## Why Design Became My Voice

For me, design isn't just a career—it's my primary medium of communication. I'll be honest: I'm not naturally inclined toward self-promotion or talking about myself. But when I'm discussing my work, explaining a design decision, or presenting a solution? That's when I come alive. Design bridges the gap where words might fail me, giving me a powerful voice to express complex ideas through visual and functional experiences.

There's this duality in my personality. Personally, I'm reserved. Professionally, when I'm in my element, I transform into someone passionate, articulate, and deeply confident. Design provides me that profound sense of satisfaction—it's the perfect blend of research (my Physics side) and creativity (my Art side).

## Where I Am Today

Currently, I'm the Director of Product Design & Web Development at DriQ Health, where I've evolved from a web designer into a strategic partner to leadership. I don't just design interfaces—I architect entire design ecosystems, from brand language to marketing visuals to physical product UX.

I'm also pursuing my Post Graduate Program in AI & ML from Caltech CTME because I believe the future lies at the intersection of design and artificial intelligence. I want to build experiences that are not just beautiful and functional, but genuinely intelligent.

## What Drives Me

I'm driven by a moonshot goal that ties back to my dual expertise in Physics and Design: Can aesthetics be converted into mathematics? Can we move beyond subjective definitions of beauty and find a way to quantify "good design" into calculable metrics? It's an undefined problem, but that's what makes it exciting.

I'm targeting high-innovation environments—places like Google DeepMind, Toyota Research Institute, NVIDIA Research, Meta Reality Labs—where I can work at the bleeding edge of AI, Robotics, and Human-Computer Interaction.

## The Resilience Chapter

I should mention something important: my career had a significant pause from November 2022 to July 2023. I survived a gas leak accident at home that resulted in 70% burns. Those months were dedicated to intense physical and mental recovery. It was the hardest period of my life, but it taught me resilience and determination that I carry with me every day.

## Beyond the Work

When I'm not designing or coding, I'm exploring. I'm an avid traveler and trekker—I believe in experiencing as much as I can to fuel my creative database. I watch Japanese dramas, K-dramas, Italian series, and English shows to understand different cultural nuances and storytelling methods. I listen to music across genres and languages. I sketch, draw, and write poetry to keep my artistic tools sharp. And I'm rekindling my passion for robotics, building hardware-software systems just like I did back in school.

At my core, I'm someone who operates at the intersection of analytical rigor and creative empathy. I'm enthusiastic, intellectually curious, and deeply invested in mentorship. Whether I'm designing a fintech app, teaching students at university, or building an AI-powered portfolio like this one, I approach every challenge as an opportunity to learn, grow, and create something meaningful. 💡
