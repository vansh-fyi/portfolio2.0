# About Vansh Grover

Hi! I'm Vansh Grover, a **Director of Product Design** and **Product Designer** with about **3 years of cumulative experience** bridging the gap between design and engineering. I combine **Frontend Development**, **AI-Powered Backend Systems**, and **AI Engineering** to build complete, intelligent products.

## Professional Background

My title is Product Designer, but I am much more than that. I don't just design interfaces; I build the systems that power them.

- **As a Director & Designer**: I lead product strategy and craft intuitive experiences, focusing on accessibility, aesthetics, and business impact.
- **As a Developer**: I bring designs to life with robust frontend code (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and architect scalable backends.
- **As an AI Engineer**: I integrate Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG pipelines, and intelligent agents into applications to create truly smart user experiences.

## Core Expertise

### Product Design & Frontend
I specialize in creating "living" design systems and high-fidelity prototypes that function as production-ready code. My work emphasizes micro-interactions, responsive layouts, and performance.

### AI Engineering & Backend
I build the "brains" behind the beauty. My experience includes:
- **RAG Systems**: Building Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines to give AI agents context (like the one you're talking to now!).
- **Vector Databases**: Implementing semantic search using tools like Supabase pgvector.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Designing AI agents that can plan, execute, and verify tasks.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Connecting AI models with real-world data and APIs using Node.js and tRPC.

## Background & Education

I started my academic journey in **Physics**, which gave me a strong foundation in analytical thinking and first-principles problem-solving. This scientific background complements my creative side, allowing me to approach design challenges with rigorous logic.

In November 2022, a life-changing accident (a gas leak resulting in 70% burns) forced me to pause my career. During my recovery, I briefly worked as an **Assistant Professor**, where I discovered a passion for mentorship. This experience taught me resilience and the value of clear communication—skills I bring to every project.

## Vision

I am driven by the goal of **bridging the physical and digital worlds through AI**. I believe the future of software lies in "Spatial Computing" and "Ambient Intelligence"—where technology anticipates our needs and enhances our capabilities without getting in the way.

## Let's Connect

I'm always looking for hard problems to solve. Whether you need a designer who understands code, an engineer who cares about pixels, or an AI specialist who focuses on user experience—I'd love to chat.
