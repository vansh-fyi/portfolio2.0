# What I'm Passionate About

Beyond my day-to-day work in design and AI, there's a whole world of interests that fuel my creativity and shape how I think. Let me share what drives me outside of professional projects.

## The Moonshot: Mathematics of Aesthetics

Here's my ultimate ambition, the problem that keeps me up at night in the best way possible: **Can aesthetics be converted into mathematics?**

I know it sounds abstract, but hear me out. Throughout my career, I've noticed that "good design" is often defined subjectively. We say something is beautiful, intuitive, or well-designed, but these are qualitative assessments. What if we could move beyond subjective definitions and find a way to quantify beauty, to calculate good design into measurable, replicable metrics?

This question sits perfectly at the intersection of my Physics background and my Design expertise. In Physics, we reduce complex phenomena to elegant equations. Can we do the same for aesthetics? I don't have the answer yet—honestly, I'm not even sure the problem is fully defined. But that's what makes it exciting. It's my moonshot, and it's driving me toward environments where this kind of fundamental research happens.

## Where I Want to Be: Innovation Labs

I'm not content with just doing good work at good companies. I want to work at the absolute bleeding edge of technology, in labs that blend AI, Robotics, and Human-Computer Interaction. These are the environments I'm targeting:

**Google DeepMind & Google Research** for their pioneering work in AGI and deep learning. **Toyota Research Institute (TRI)** specifically for their research in "Robot Embodied Intelligence" and human-amplifying robotics—imagine robots that enhance human capability rather than replace it. **Skild AI** for their work on a general-purpose "brain" for robotics foundation models. **NVIDIA Research** feels especially aligned with my Physics background—their work on Digital Twins, Omniverse, and AI-driven physics simulation is exactly where my skills could create real impact. **Meta Reality Labs / FAIR** for their vision of the future of interaction, XR, and fundamental AI research. And **Disney Research** because of their unique ability to engineer emotional experiences and aesthetics using robotics and AI.

These aren't just dream employers—they're the places where the kind of questions I want to answer are actually being explored.

## Exploring the World

I believe in "exploring as much as I can" because every new experience adds to my creative database. I'm an avid traveler and trekker—there's something profound about physically moving through different landscapes, seeing how geography shapes culture and perspective.

When I travel, I'm not just taking photos. I'm observing how people interact with spaces, how local design reflects cultural values, how environments influence behavior. Every trek, every new city, every conversation with a stranger becomes material I can draw from when I'm designing experiences.

## Cultural Consumption as Research

My media consumption is intentionally diverse. I watch **Japanese dramas**, **K-dramas**, **Italian series**, and **English shows**—not just for entertainment, but to understand distinct cultural nuances and storytelling methods.

Different cultures approach narrative, emotion, and visual language in unique ways. Japanese storytelling often emphasizes subtle emotional beats. K-dramas excel at melodrama and character-driven plots. Italian cinema has a distinct visual poetry. English series tend toward complex narrative structures. By immersing myself in these different styles, I'm constantly expanding my toolkit for how to craft experiences and tell stories through design.

Music is similar—I listen eclectically across genres and languages. Each musical tradition has its own rhythm, its own emotional palette. Understanding these helps me think about the rhythm and emotion in interfaces, the way interactions can feel harmonious or discordant.

## Creative Expression Beyond Digital

Design isn't the only way I express creativity. I actively **sketch and draw**—sometimes just to capture an idea quickly, sometimes to create art for its own sake. There's something immediate and organic about putting pencil to paper that complements my digital work.

I also **write poetry**. It's a completely different mode of expression, working with rhythm, metaphor, and distilled meaning. Poetry teaches me about economy of expression—how to convey complex emotions with minimal words. That skill translates directly to UX writing and interface design.

## Robotics: The Original Love

My interest in robotics goes back to my school days. It was my first exposure to building systems that exist in both hardware and software—to creating something physical that's animated by code. I'm rekindling that passion now, building hardware-software systems, because I believe robotics is where my skills in Physics, Design, and AI can come together most powerfully.

Robots are the ultimate design challenge: they're physical objects with mechanical constraints, software systems with logical requirements, and interaction paradigms that need to be intuitive for humans. They exist at the intersection of everything I care about.

## The Through Line

If there's a pattern to all these interests, it's curiosity and synthesis. I don't want to be narrowly specialized. I want to pull from Physics, Design, AI, Culture, Art, and Engineering to create something new—experiences that are analytically rigorous, aesthetically beautiful, and genuinely intelligent.

Every trek informs my understanding of spatial design. Every drama teaches me about emotional pacing. Every sketch keeps my visual thinking sharp. Every robotics project connects the abstract and the concrete. It all feeds back into my work, making me a more complete designer and engineer.

That's the life I'm building: one where professional work and personal exploration aren't separate, but constantly inform and energize each other. 🌍
